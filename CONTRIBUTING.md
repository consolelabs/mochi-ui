## Development Process

Web Foundation operates on a monorepo structure, containing both UI packages and
applications. Each component and application is treated as an independent unit.

### Packages Development

For package development, we use the following tools:

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/): Manages packages and dependencies.
- [Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/): Bundles packages.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): Facilitates UI component development
  and testing.
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/): Tests components and hooks.
- [Changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets): Manages changes
  documentation, changelog generation, and release.

**Commands**

- `pnpm install`: Bootstraps the project, symlinks dependencies, and builds
  components.
- `pnpm storybook`: Launches Storybook server for UI component development.
- `pnpm build:packages`: Builds all component packages.
- `pnpm test:packages`: Runs tests across all component packages.

### Application Development

For developing applications within the monorepo, the process is streamlined:

**Commands**

- `pnpm install`: Bootstraps the project, symlinks dependencies, and builds
  components.
- `pnpm dev:app-slug`: Starts the development server for a specific application.
  Replace `app-slug`` with the appropriate application identifier.
- `pnpm build:app-slug`: Builds a specific application.
- `pnpm test:app-slug`: Runs tests for a specific application.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please follow the issue template and provide a detailed
