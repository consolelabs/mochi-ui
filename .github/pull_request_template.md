**What does this PR do?**

- [x] My bugfix

**Related Ticket(s)**

- Notion Ticket

**Key Changes**

- How does the code change address the issue? Describe, at a high level, what
  was done to affect change.
- What side effects does this change have? This is the most important question
  to answer, as it can point out problems where you are making too many changes
  in one commit or branch. One or two bullet points for related changes may be
  okay, but five or six are likely indicators of a commit that is doing too many
  things.

**How to test**

- Create a detailed description of what you need to do to set this PR up. ie:
  Does it need migrations? Do you need to install something?
- Create a step by step list of what the engineer needs to do to test.

**Media (Loom or gif)**

- Insert media here (if applicable)
