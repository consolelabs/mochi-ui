# Introduction

Mochi UI is a React-based UI toolkit designed to create beautiful and accessible
interfaces, particularly for web3 projects. It leverages the capabilities of
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) as its foundation.

The main objective of this library is to simplify the development workflow,
enabling faster creation of web applications with an improved user experience.
