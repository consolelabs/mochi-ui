# Design Philosophy

Console Labs UI adheres to key principles ensuring consistency and reliability
in its components. Understanding these principles is crucial for effective
contribution to the library.

Our aim is to craft straightforward, modular components that address common UI
design challenges. We adhere to a set of guidelines to maintain this focus.

#### Simplicity

We prioritize simplicity in our component APIs, showcasing practical use cases.

#### Composition

We design components as small, manageable units with minimal properties,
allowing for easy composition and ensuring style and functionality are both
flexible and extendable.

#### Accessibility

Accessibility is a core consideration in our component design, encompassing
aspects like keyboard navigation, focus management, color contrast, voice-over
compatibility, and appropriate use of `aria-*` attributes.

#### API Consistency

Console Labs UI maintains a uniform API across all components. Common attributes
are consistently named, using auxiliary verbs like `does`, `has`, `is`, `and`
`should`, facilitating predictability and easing the learning process for
developers.

#### Adherence to Web Standards

Our components mirror native web attributes. For instance, form components
include `value` and `onChange` props, and the Button component supports
attributes like `disabled` and `loading`.
